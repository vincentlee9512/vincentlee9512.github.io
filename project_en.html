        <h6>Computer Architecture Project: Cache Simulator</h6>
        <p>
            In this project, I created a CPU cache simulator with James Allender.
            This program was wrote in C.
            The goal of this CPU cache simulator is to simulate how a cache works in a computer system through intercepting the processor's memory requests and handling the retrieving and storing to and from the memory.
            I was mainly in charge of part of the cache structure design and handlers of read requests.

        <h6>Computer Architecture Project: Pipeline Implementation</h6>
        <p>
            In this project, I implemented a pipeline design datapath(which was customized for this course) with James Allender.
            This program was wrote in C.
            The goal for this pipeline design datapath is to simulate the input machine code with correct behavior.
            I was mainly in charge of developing the several stages in the datapath and the forwarding unit which is used for handling data hazard.

        <h6>Computer Architecture Project: Performance Analysis</h6>
        <p>
            In this project, I analysed the performance between single cycle and multicycle CPU design with Lucy Post.
            We created the multicycle CPU design based on the previous simulator; the previous simulator is based on single cycle CPU design.

        <h6>Computer Architecture Project: Assembler and Simulator</h6>
        <p>
            In this project, I have created an assembly-language program and behavioral simulator with Lucy Post.
            These two program were wrote in C.
            The goal for the assembly-language program is to translate assembly-language
            (which was customized for this course) into the corresponding machine code for simulator.
            The goal for the behavioral simulator is to simulate the machine state(behavior) by executing the input machine code from the assembly-language program above.
            I was mainly in charge of developing the assembly-language program.

        <h6>Web Video-game: Space Ships</h6>
        <p>
          In this project, I have created a web video-game with Chase Lau and Olive O'Keefe. This project includes a web server with using socket.io to pass data between server and clients and a web site with the simple video-game which is built by Phaser 3. I was mainly in charge of socket.io connections.

        <h6>Dynamic web server: Movie Wiki</h6>
        <p>
          In this project, I have created a dynamic web application about television and movies with Emily Meuer. This project includes a web server to interact with an SQL database and a web pages that access to the server. In this project, I was mainly in charge of handling requests in the server, creating interaction between server and database, formating the callback data, and filters function at the web sites. <br/>
          -Github: <a href="https://github.com/EmilyMeuer/movieWiki" target="_blank">MovieWiki Github Repository</a> <br/>
          After the project, I built my own server throught AWS' EC2 virtual machine, and use express-generator to organize the
          code and improve the efficiency on the server side. <br/>

        <h6>Web App: Air Quality Detector</h6>
        <p>
          In this project, I have created a single page application about air application with Bobby Martin. This project used 2 external APIs to retrieve data from 
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> and 
          <a href="https://docs.openaq.org/" target="_blank">Open AQ Platform</a>. 
          This project also used Angular.js and bootstrap to make the application more responsive. In this project, I was mainly in charge of retrieving data from both APIs, formatting the data for displaying, and filter functions. <br/>

        <h6>Productivity Web Site: To-Do List</h6>
        <p>
          In this project, I have created a to-do list web site with the plain Javascript and plain CSS. This web site uses the browser's local storage to keep the data of users. This was a practice assignment for basic Javascript, CSS & HTML5.
